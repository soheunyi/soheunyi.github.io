Hi! I am Soheun Yi, a second-year PhD student at Department of Statistics & Data Science, Carnegie Mellon University.

My research interest spans theoretical aspects of machine learning, somewhere between optimization theory and statistics.
I am particularly fascinated by those topics that are inspired by real-world applications.

I am working on applications of statistics and machine learning to [physical sciences][yialisonkuusela2024ml4ps].
Before starting my PhD, I was a research scientist at [Krafton AI][kraftonai].
During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Ernest K. Ryu][Ryu] and [Sanghack Lee][Lee].
I started my research journey on theoretical aspects of machine learning, mainly on [optimization theory][yileeryu2024siopt] and [graphical models][yilee2024aistats].

I was a quantitative analyst in [Hyperithm][hyperithm], where I built a solid background in data analysis, especially in processing and analyzing large datasets. 

You can find my CV [here](../assets/soheunyi_cv.pdf).
