title: About
---
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences from Seoul National University. 

I study theoretical aspects of machine learning, ranging from optimization theory to statistics.
My recent interest spans optimal transport and continuous dynamics with real-world applications, including [physical sciences][yialisonkuusela2024ml4ps].

Prior to CMU, I worked as a research scientist at [Krafton AI][kraftonai] and as a quantitative analyst in [Hyperithm][hyperithm].
At SNU, I was fortunate to be advised by Professors [Ernest K. Ryu][Ryu] and [Sanghack Lee][Lee], on research projects around theoretical aspects of machine learning, mainly [optimization theory][yileeryu2024siopt] and [graphical models][yilee2024aistats].

You can find my CV [here](../assets/soheunyi_cv.pdf).
