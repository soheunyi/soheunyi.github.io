I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences from Seoul National University. 

I study theoretical aspects of machine learning, ranging from optimization theory to statistics.
My recent interest spans optimal transport and continuous dynamics with real-world applications, including [physical sciences][yialisonkuusela2024ml4ps]{:target="_blank"}.

Prior to CMU, I worked as a research scientist at [Krafton AI][kraftonai]{:target="_blank"} and as a quantitative analyst in [Hyperithm][hyperithm]{:target="_blank"}.
At SNU, I was fortunate to be advised by Professors [Ernest K. Ryu][Ryu]{:target="_blank"} and [Sanghack Lee][Lee]{:target="_blank"} on research projects around theoretical aspects of machine learning, mainly [optimization theory][yileeryu2024siopt]{:target="_blank"} and [graphical models][yilee2024aistats]{:target="_blank"}.

You can find my CV [here](../assets/soheunyi_cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
