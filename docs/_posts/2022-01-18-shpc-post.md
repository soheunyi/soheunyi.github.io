I attended "Scalable High Performance Computing" in 2021 Fall. The class had gone through interesting topics about recent CPUs and GPUs, and the term project was exciting: parallelizing the transposed convolution in a generator of [DCGAN architecture](https://paperswithcode.com/method/dcgan){:target="_blank"}.

I have implemented a few techniques to parallelize transposed convolution. First, I have reduced unnecessary divergence(if-branches) to make the code friendly with the lock-step architecture of GPUs; since all streaming cores in a warp fetch instructions both from true and false blocks, including many if-branches, become overhead to the program.

Second, I tried to express transposed convolution as (massive) matrix multiplication. The motivation for this was that matrix multiplication is highly parallelizable. There are extremely fast matrix multiplication algorithms; thus, I would benefit from those if I regard transposed convolution as matrix multiplication. Designing and implementing this notion was very painful: building and reshaping the matrix in C was confusing, and debugging CUDA codes without using `printf` (which I thought I could not use in GPUs) was vastly time-consuming. Mainly, the arcane behaviors of C language macro fooled me; it made me waste a day debugging my code.

Going through these efforts, I could largely shorten the process of transposed convolution. The initial sequential CPU implementation of the method was excruciatingly long: it took longer than 1 minute to generate a single artificial face portrait. So, in theory, it would have taken longer than 16 hours to generate 1000 faces. However, implementing the generator in CUDA GPUs essentially shortened the process: I ended up with the project generating 1000 faces in under 0.2 seconds. With 5000 times boost in the process, I was pleased about how far computing technology would enhance human lives. It will take humankind to the level we could never reach without computers!
